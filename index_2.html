        <p>Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
            I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
            She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her
            Thumb in the shape of an "L" on her forehead

            Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
            Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
            Didn't make sense not to live for fun
            Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
            So much to do so much to see
            So what's wrong with taking the back streets
            You'll never know if you don't go
            You'll never shine if you don't glow
            </p>
